        Creativity is a core component of a Justice Senior High. Throughout our
        academic and co-curricular programs, we encourage students to bring
        original ideas to life, construct new theories, turn standard assignment
        into boundary-bending projects, and fashion inventive ways to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our Arts program, we specifically nurture our students' innate
        creative drive, inspiring them to explore the inviting world of artistic
        expression. Through music, the visual arts, theater and other mediums,
        students produce art that reinforces learning, introduces beauty and
        meaning into their world and brings our community together.
